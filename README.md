Loan Prediction
-----------------------

The goal of this project is to use machine learning to be able to predict whether or not loans that were acquired by Fannie Mae will be foreclosed. All data used in this project is from [here](http://www.fanniemae.com/portal/funding-the-market/data/loan-performance-data.html).
